You are tasked with creating a simple task management application using Vue.js and Tailwind.css. The application should allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

    Create a responsive UI that looks good on different screen sizes.
    Use Git for version control and commit your changes regularly.

    Correctness of application functionality.
    Proper implementation of Vue.js, Tailwind.css, Vuex, Axios, and JavaScript.

    UI/UX design and responsiveness.

Instructions:

    Create a new repository.
    Complete the task management application as per the requirements mentioned above.
